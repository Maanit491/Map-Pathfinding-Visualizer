# Map Pathfinding Visualizer

Map Pathfinding Visualizer is a web application built with React.js and JavaScript that allows users to visualize and compute shortest paths between two points on global maps using various algorithms.

## Features

- **Algorithm Support**: Implements A*, Greedy, Dijkstra's, and Bidirectional Search algorithms.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Animates pathfinding process with adjustable speed and replay functionality.
- **Customizable Map Settings**: Users can modify the map radius to explore different regions.
- **Real-Time Traffic Integration**: Enhances route planning with live traffic data for accurate navigation solutions.
